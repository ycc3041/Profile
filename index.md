# About 
Hi I am Yung Ching Chen. You can also call me Zoe. I graduated from Purdue University in 2020 with an MS degree in industrial engineering. My specializations are operations research and data science. I also have worked  in both startups and big corporations including Yahoo and Disney. I am very passionate about applying scientific and analytical methods to get insights from data and utilizing the results to do better decision making. I enjoy learning new knowledge as well as solving challenging data problems.
